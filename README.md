# The Shoppies (OMDB Movie Search)

This web application was created in response to a coding challenge for a front-end developer position. The site uses the OMDB API to search for and display movies based on a user's query. The user has the ability to save/remove movies from their favorites list. This is possible because of a remote MongoDB Atlas database.

If a movie is added to the favorites list, its save button will be disabled, preventing duplicate movies. If it is removed from the list, its save button will be re-enabled.
